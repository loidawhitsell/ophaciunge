Was wondering if anyone has this same problem as I do: I have created a custom GO Locker theme, followed the instructions included with the template downloaded for the GO Dev Team's website and everything goes good until I try to go into the "My Locker" section of GO Locker to try and set it as my default locker screen because it won't show up even though there were no problems at all while I was building the apk, signing or zip-aligning it.

TL;DR AT THE END! So, you may remember me from when I mentioned Satan yelling at me about a year ago over my friends death. Here’s a new story, from this year :), so, where I skate we have annual ice shows. Our ice shows have soloist, duet(s), trio(s), Courtet(s), private groups A-D (usually only A-C though, private groups are just, groups for little kids/skaters who can high enough for specialty numbers or solos) Theatre on ice, and synchronized skating team.

Hi all, Just to recap, I am a huge, old time fan of Classic Who, but I have struggled to get into Nu-Who, until now. Thanks to the joy of Netflix I am slowly catching up. I have just watched season 6! I have to start with a brief overview of the Doctor himself. Matt Smith continues to impress, and his characterisation from the writers is pretty spot on too. I would say he has comfortably made it into my top 5 favourite Doctors of all time. Also, a quick note on The Ponds/William's. There. the cat to copy Right now, the # 2 seeded Denver Nuggets are leading the San Antonio Spurs and verging on the second round of the playoffs. But this breakthrough season hasn't happened overnight (even if it's felt like that to some degree after missing the playoffs last year.) The Nuggets had some great seasons under George Karl, but after that ended, it appeared that they'd be sinking down into irrelevancy. They finished 36-46. 30-52. 33-49. The dreaded lower "middle class" First I want to apologize for this being so late. I don't have a good excuse, I just completely did not give myself enough time to learn reddit formatting, and did not want to send out tables that weren't formatted in this write up. Better late than never, I guess. Enough people have expressed their anger through PMs, but I want to make sure it's known that the tardiness is my fault, not any of the people who helped out with this post. They did a fantastic job and deserve a ton of recognition. And shepherds we shall be For Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

The season is dead…but there is still hockey to be seen from the farm team! Tonight the farm squad faces off against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. The Penguins sit precariously in 6th place in the AHL’s Atlantic division, and are currently riding a 2 game losing streak; a pretty awful time to go on a losing streak when you’re literally THIS CLOSE to Calder playoffs! Sneaking into the 5th place spot with only 4 points behind the Providence. Title. It's my day off, and I was just thinking about some power ideas for future killers. amp#x200B; Firecrackers This would make the most sense for a Chinese killer since, fun fact, Fireworks were made in Medival China around the early 9th century and, at that time, their main purpose was to scare away evil spirits rather than entertain the masses, though I'm sure that idea quickly followed. The killer could be like the Plague and be from an early civlization. amp#x200B; Anyways. 
It’s Monday night raw and Alexa Bliss comes out to the ring wearing her leather pants and a black top and is preparing for a moment of bliss “Well ladies and gentleman here we go again, another fabulous edition of….” Starts Alexa. Suddenly Lacey Evans theme song plays and she walks out of the ring and starts to head back “I am fucking sick and tired of this” screams Alexa. “Why is it every single week I come out here to deliver a pure moment of bliss, does every bitch backstage I have always had a fear of roller coasters for most of my life. I worried that they were trying to kill me and make me throw up. Every single damn time I went to a theme park, especially for school sanctioned trips, I refused to go on a single roller coaster because they looked like scribbles on a page. As a result, I had nothing to do and I had no fun. I lost so many opportunities of fun all because of my fears. There was a band sanctioned trip to a theme park coming up and I was debating. </p>
