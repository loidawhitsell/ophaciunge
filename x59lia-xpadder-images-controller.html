                            <p>Hey guys just finished updating my Xpadder controller images folder. Does anyone have any images that I am missing if so, would you mind sharing them? I really want the following controller images: Nintendo 3Ds, Nintendo Switch Controller, Nintendo Wii Classic Pro, Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers (L -R), and the following light guns: RF, EMS TopGun 2 amp 3, AimTrak, DreamGEAR Quick Shot Plus (Wii). Anyone that has any images that they are willing to share I’d greatly appreciate it, thank. I rely on Xpadder quite a bit in many different types of games, I think I get most of the syntax and the program usually allows me to do what I want it to. I am not so sure about the relationship between profiles and controller files. I usually have to create unique profile and controller files for each game. My problem is I can't figure out how to launch Xpadder with both a specific profile and a specific controller file. I am able to create shortcuts that load either a specific profile.  Hi guys it has been ages since I programmed stuff, but was never any real good anyways in thinking up my own stuff. but it got the job done mostly by using parts of others etc! Then after a while I barely had to use it for anything cuz of the Internet wheels where reinvented all the time, I just used stuff others made and that worked :) Now fast forward to 2018. I only recently started exploring DCC modeltrains I can control them via Mouse/KB (with their default software, although limited. All software listed here is free  This turned out to be a community project of recommended software.

Hello everyone. I'm primarily a console player but I regularly play on PC almost exclusively with a controller. It's just personal preference, but I've wanted to make this post because controllers and consoles tend to be the reason for the "dumbing down" of certain games/series which is a popular and justified complaint among PC players. As primarily a console player for most of my life, this is frustrating being the brunt of the stigma, but there's no doubt it has happened over the years. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/WonderSwan-Black-Left.jpg/1200px-WonderSwan-Black-Left.jpg The wonderswan is one of the most difficult consoles to emulate. Not because the hardware is powerful or obscure - its a well documented handheld with several high quality emulators. No, the difficult thing about the wonderswan is its completely unemulatable controls. Wonderswan games allow you to play in either landscape mode, using the X buttons as a dpad and the B/A buttons Hello everyone. I'm primarily a console player but I regularly play on PC almost exclusively with a controller. It's just personal preference, but I've wanted to make this post for a while because controllers and consoles tend to be the reason for the "dumbing down" of certain games/series which is a popular and justified complaint among PC players. As primarily a console player for most of my life, this is frustrating being the brunt of the stigma, but there's no doubt it has happened # This guide is to help people who want to use Xpadder for controller support on Bless NA so just follow the steps below. Turning off the broken in\-game controller support. We will need to edit the BaseInput.ini file located in C:\Program Files \(x86\)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bless Online\Engine\Config an image can be seen here https://i.imgur.com/OTegI29.png (https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://i.imgur.com/OTegI29.png) Open up BaseInput.ini in notepad or whatev. Question: How can we help Valve spread the word about the Steam Input Configuration Software (SICS)? Context: With the release of Dragon Ball Fighters Z today, threads have been popping up across the internet regarding the small pool of supported fight sticks for the PC port. For the most part, the generally known fix is to use Joy2Key (of all things.). And a little ways down these threads you'll find someone reply along the lines of "look at this Big Picture Mode fix that I found youtube. If someone asks me why I prefer PC gaming over consoles, I tell them I love the possibilities and the freedom. If I dont like something or if I'm not enirely satisfied, I can take matters into my own hands and just change it. If you compare gaming to suits, then a console is a nice suit that fits most people well enough and looks good. PC gaming is a custom-made suit, tailored to you . It fits perfectly, looks good, and you feel comfortable in it. Somebody else might I searched extensively to figure this out. It’s a bit of a hack, but it is working pretty solid now so I thought I’d share. Here is what I’m trying to accomplish: - Launch Cemu games from my NVidia Shield TV (2017 version) using the Shield Controllers - My 6 year old should not need to enter Cemu or change any inputs / configurations - Multiplayer needs to work with my Shield Controllers Before we get into the Gamestream part of the equation, let’s talk about controller configuration. Figuri. For those not in the know, it is a fan project that puts Morrowind into Oblivion's engine. Pretty much everything is finished and now these people are working on Skywind Anyway, I wanted to replay Morrowind, one of my favorite games. I tired a few years ago, but I had a hard time, some of it was I didn't have the time to devote to it, the second was, I didn't like playing it with m/kb. I originally played it on Xbox. I figured I'd try this Morrowblivion out, now Oblivion didn't have contro. 
Comment below if your question is not answered ! Any contribution is appreciated. Last updated on: 2017.05.15. ampnbsp; ##1. Where do I download a Super Mario Maker wud/iso/rom and how do I install it? The easiest way to download and update your games is via Wii U USB Helper (https://www.wiiuusbhelper.com/) Setup: When you first start Wii U USB Helper you will be prompted to insert a link to decrypt files. Use this one: You should. Comment below if your question is not listed 1. Where do I download a Super Mario Maker wud/iso/rom? I downloaded mine from portalroms ( BUT I highly suggest you look at question 3 as you can download a Super Mario Maker rpx file (Cemu compatible) that contains the latest Content Update. 2. What version of Super Mario Maker (US, EUR, JPN) should I use? In my opinion, you should use the EUR version. I actually don't have a PS3 or PS4 controller so i can't play games on PS Now but i have this : It can be used on a PC but with Xpadder or some sheits like that but i can't find how to use it as a compatible Dualshock 3/4 on PS Now Someone https://i.imgur.com/ZAsYGca.jpg I know I was disappointed to find out the lauded mod didn't work with controllers! Made this for myself and thought I may as well share! This is not a perfect utilisation of PC controls via a pad, instead more a direct recreation of the vanilla games controller layout, to allow controller familiar PC players to jump into Long War. It's not quite a 1;1 recreation but the result should be intuitive and instantly familiar to controller users 
Love the concept, and have enjoyed what little of the story I've seen so far. Expect to spend some time practicing the arcade-like ship and lander maneuvering, though. I personally find the lander really annoying to fly. It's basically an updated version of the ancient Lunar Lander game, plus strong winds shoving you around. Vertical and horizontal speeds are displayed, but only up in the right corner of the screen, and taking your eyes off the little lander image is risking your pilot's life. Original Post ( Full Album ( I’m going to start this off and say that no working NES’s were harmed in this process, I bought a non-working shell with mangled insides for  off of Ebay. Now that that’s cleared up and those accusing me of the heinous crime of making these limited systems even more limited can relax and learn how to make their own. I’m not quite ========================================== How to setup Assetto Corsa for the Oculus Rift DK2 ========================================== IMPORTANT: THE INFORMATION HERE IS BEING LEFT UP FOR LEGACY REASONS, BUT THERE IS NOW A WIKI PAGE THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE SPOT TO FIND THIS CONTENT, OR EVEN CONTRIBUTE. PLEASE GO TO THE WIKI BY CLICKING ON THIS LINK ( If you don't know what Assetto Corsa is, or need to buy it, then click Tl;DR: I believe android is a valid gaming platform for casual gamers (and maybe also for more hardcore ones), with truckloads of titles spanning over the most common gaming genres. Nevertheless trying to have a "android gaming console" is not yet completely possible since many titles do not allow "hardcore" gaming, I think this will change over time. The Nvidia Shield (k1) with the shield controller (suggested, if one wants to use a controller in games that do not support it, without rooting). Hi, I've read quite a few threads here regarding the GPD and button/game mapping etc. A lot of comments say its difficult to map as you have to use the touchscreen, but this is SO NOT the case. I apologise if this has been covered before, but you can easily map EVERY button, trigger, nub etc using xpadder with the MOUSE and MOUSE BUTTONS. And apart from the very first 20 second set up to create a generic map on xpadder, then every game game be mapped using the mouse etc with no problems. Greetings Commanders, I, like many of you, am using a gamepad to control my ship. One day soon I will upgrade to HOTAS, but for now, I'm stuck with this economical MadCatz Xbox360 compatible controller ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Drbao2zcL._SX385_.jpg). It was to my dismay that I discovered that you couldn't use the triggers to control (analogue) yaw. You can set "yaw left" to left trigger, and "yaw right" to right trigger, but this results in an all-or-nothing. Hi! I just finished putting 49 hours into unstable, on top of 330ish hours in stable through the last couple years. I LOVE starbound. This update coming out is mind blowingly awesome. I figured I'd give some of my feedback! Warning: It's super long. ampnbsp; So, heart of the ruin was amazing. That was a crazy fun, long, stressful and hard to manage battle - while the AI in total was simple, the combination of behaviors together made for a really great fight. but one thing I thought Hello community, this will be a nice little how-to explaining how to play Trove with a controller since the game doesn't natively support them, and how to use your phone for chat if you are so inclined. Playing xPadder This is a program that lets you assign keyboard buttons to the buttons on your controller, and makes that work system wide (instead of only in game like emulators will). Download xPadder here ( Controller Setup.
